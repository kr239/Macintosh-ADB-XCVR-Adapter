# Macintosh-ADB-XCVR-Adapter

This will allow the use of the PLCC ADB Transceiver in the Macintosh SE, which is the only model that uses a DIP18 part.

Just upload the zip to JLCPCB, it's simply one PLCC28 socket (SMT) and headers.

Both of these ADB Transceivers are based on the same PIC16CR54 - albeit slightly customised by Microchip, for Apple, with regards to the TRIS register.
